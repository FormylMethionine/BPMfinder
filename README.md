# Tempo prediction using CNN

This project is a side effect of [another project](OnsetCNN).
The goal here is to predict the tempo in beats per minute of a song using
short term Fourier analysis and CNN.

**WIP**

## To do:
- Change the parser to obtain correct data for bpm prediction
- Adapt the model and the training loop
- Find more data from more varied genres
- Split data between train, test and eval datasets
- Train the network
